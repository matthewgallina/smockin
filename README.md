### OVERVIEW

sMockin is an API mocking tool used to dynamically simulate HTTP endpoints.

Featuring a rich UI and HTTP mock server, replicating existing or creating new APIs can be done quickly both with JavaScript or without code.

Whether you are a developer who needs to simulate RESTFul endpoints or an engineer working with complex SOA / IoT / microservice infrastructure, sMockin can help by mimicking any services that are either unavailable or otherwise too difficult or time consuming to set up.

sMockin runs as a small web app which can be either installed locally onto a personal machine or hosted centrally and used by multiple users.

### RECENT RELEASE CHANGES

<br />

**New in version 2.11.0**

- Introducing Block, mock and Swap!

With a number of users discovering sMockin as a great way to monitor live dev traffic, you can now intercept and manipulate on the fly, any requests via the live logging tool.

Combined with the proxy server, this now gives developers and QA engineers, complete visibility and control over all HTTP traffic running between your applications.

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.10.0**

- The sMockin proxy server now supports multiple url destinations which can be mapped to specific paths.

For example, say you are running 3 independent microservices for each of the following services:

```
/v1/product   -> localhost:9001
/v1/customer  -> localhost:9002
/v1/address   -> localhost:9003
```

You can now add these 'Path to URL' mappings to sMockin and then decide whether swap out any traffic between these services and the end user with mocked responses using various strategies.

This can be highly useful for either temporarily modifying an existing API or adding (mocking) an entirely new endpoint.

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.9**

- Added ability to run sMockin as a proxy server so this can sit between any application and the downstream server it would normally make API calls too.

- Proxy mode can be run in 2 ways:

**Option A** sMockin will attempt to find a mock first and only forward the request to your server downstream if a mock could not be found.

**Option B** sMockin will forward the request to the server downstream first and then try to find a suitable mock if the downstream server returns a 404.

- Please note, proxy mode is not available when running sMockin in 'multi user' mode.

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.8**

- Added the ability to save Key / Value pair data which can be recalled in your mock responses.

To add Key / Value data, click on the drop down box list from the top right hand corner of the UI and select **Manage Key/Value Data**. 

To then reference your Key / Value data in your mock responses, this can be achieved as follows:

For **Response Variables** syntax:

```
$lookUpKvp(kvpKeyName)
```

Or if using a **Custom JavaScript** based mock:

```
lookUpKvp('kvpKeyName');
```

For greater flexibility, you can also reference inbound request values as part of your lookup like so:

**Response Variables** syntax:

```
$lookUpKvp($requestParameter(firstName))
```

**Custom JavaScript** syntax:

```
lookUpKvp(request.parameters.firstName);
```

<br />

- Changes to the syntax format used in **Response Variables**.

For example: 

```
${REQ_PARAM=firstName} is now be expressed as $requestParameter(firstName)
${REQ_HEAD=firstName} is expressed as $requestHeader(firstName)
${REQ_PARAM=firstName} is expressed as $requestParameter(firstName)
${PATH_VAR=firstName} is expressed as $pathVar(firstName)
${RANDOM_NUMBER=1 TO 10} is expressed as $randomNumber(1, 10) or $randomNumber(10)
${ISO_DATETIME} is expressed as $isoDatetime
${ISO_DATE} is expressed as $isoDate
${UUID} is expressed as $uuid

$requestBody has been added as a new option
```

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.7**

- Introducing **'Stateful REST'** mocking. Mocked endpoints using this feature, can cache and manage JSON state based on the RESTful instructions they receive, helping to mimic 'real world' data behavior.

<br />

To give it a go, simply create a new mock (e.g /pets) selecting the 'Stateful REST' type and save.

<br />

Then run the following calls to see it immediately action:

> curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/pets

> curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/pets -d '{ "name" : "fido", "age" : 4, "type" : "DOG" }'

> curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/pets -d '{ "name" : "minty", "age" : 6, "type" : "CAT" }'

<br />

Your next call to GET /pets should return the following:

> curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/pets

```
[
  {
    "name": "fido",
    "age": 4,
    "type": "DOG",
    "id": "223af502-ae81-4274-9101-4886821ea823"
  },
  {
    "name": "minty",
    "age": 6,
    "type": "CAT",
    "id": "0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5"
  }
]
```

<br />

You can proceed to GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE your mock using the generated id...

> curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/pets/0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5

> curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:8001/pets/0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5 -d '{ "id" : "0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5", "name" : "Minty", "age" : 7, "type" : "CAT" }'

> curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/pets/0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5 - d '{ "op" : "REPLACE", "path" : "/name", "value" : "Minty Mi" }'

> curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8001/pets/0a1c837a-8cd5-4a3c-b2e8-a519933e99d5

### ABOUT

sMockin is designed and actively maintained by Matthew Gallina.

Why the name sMockin? Whilst it may sound like an old english middle ages embroidery technique, the name actually came about more in relation to a classic Jim Carey movie quote 'Smokin'.

...and yes, far too much thought and time went into it.
