### OVERVIEW

sMockin is a development tool used to dynamically mock API endpoints, S3 buckets & Email Accounts.

Featuring a rich UI an built in mock servers, creating and managing mocks can be done quickly, both with or without code.

Whether you are a developer who needs to simulate RESTFul API endpoints or an engineer working with complex microservice infrastructure, sMockin can help by mimicking any services that are either unavailable or otherwise too difficult or time consuming to set up.

sMockin runs as a small web app which can be either installed locally onto a personal machine or hosted centrally and used by multiple users.

### RECENT RELEASE FEATURES

<br />

**IMPORTANT! New in version 2.19.0**

From 2.19.0 onwards, sMockin's internal H2 database has been upgraded to v2.1 (moving away from v1.4).

Unfortunately v2 of H2 is not backwards compatible with v1.4, which means you will need to export your existing data and migrate this to the new DB.

<br />

**NOTE, the latest version of sMockin to continue using v1.4 of H2 will be kept here:**

https://github.com/matthewgallina/smockin/tree/2.18.4

<br />

To upgrade to 2.19.0, please follow the steps below:

1. In your current version of sMockin (2.18.x or earlier), use the **Export** feature to backup any mock data your wish to keep.
2. Next, go to the *user home* directory sMockin is running from and rename the config directory **.smockin** to **.smockin_2.18.4**.
3. Download version 2.19.0 (or later) of sMockin. We recommend keeping the previous version of sMockin on your system also for the short term, so you can switch between versions until all of your data has been moved across.
4. Using the new version of sMockin, run the **install** script. This will create a new **.smockin** config directory, containing the newer H2 database.
5. Launch the new version of sMockin using one of the **start/run** scripts.
6. From the sMockin dashboard, use the **Import** feature to save your mock data to the new database.

<br />

Unfortunately not all data can be automatically exported and so will need to be handled manually. This includes: 

- Mail mocks and messages
- Server configuration
- Key/Value Data

<br />

Should you wish to switch between versions of sMockin (as suggested above), then this can be done by simply switching the **.smockin** config directory in your *user home* and ensuring this aligns with version of sMockin you wish to run.

A good practice we advise is to rename/suffix any unused **.smockin** config directories with the version of the sMockin application they align too, so as to make them easily identifiable.

For example:

**.smockin_2.18.4** <- unused config dir
<br />
**.smockin_2.19.0** <- unused config dir
<br />
**.smockin** <- this is the active config dir


<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.18.0**

- Introducing the Email Mock Server!

1. Swap in the sMockin mock mail server (running on port 8003) as your application's delivery mail server.
2. Create Email accounts in the sMockin UI.
3. View all received email messages from the UI (including mail attachments).
4. Support for mail inbox auto-generation so as to support random addresses during testing.

Mail messages can be stored in-memory or saved to database.


<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.17.0**

- Introducing S3 bucket mocking!

Simply create a mock bucket, build your S3 content and point your application to the S3 mock server.

Featuring different synchronisation modes, developing and testing around S3 has never been easier.

Once you've created your first bucket, this can be accessed from port 8002 using any S3 client like so:

![s3 client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgtechsoftware/smockin/master/public/image/s3-client.png)

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.11.0**

- Introducing Block, mock and Swap!

With a number of users discovering sMockin as a great way to monitor live dev traffic, you can now intercept and manipulate on the fly, any requests via the live logging tool.

Combined with the proxy server, this now gives developers and QA engineers, complete visibility and control over all HTTP traffic running between your applications.

<br />
<br />


**New in version 2.10.0**

- The sMockin proxy server now supports multiple url destinations which can be mapped to specific paths.

For example, say you are running 3 independent microservices for each of the following services:

```
/v1/product   -> localhost:9001
/v1/customer  -> localhost:9002
/v1/address   -> localhost:9003
```

You can now add these 'Path to URL' mappings to sMockin and then decide whether swap out any traffic between these services and the end user with mocked responses using various strategies.

This can be highly useful for either temporarily modifying an existing API or adding (mocking) an entirely new endpoint.

### ABOUT

sMockin is designed and actively maintained by Matthew Gallina.

Why the name sMockin? Whilst it may sound like an old english middle ages embroidery technique, the name actually came about more in relation to a classic Jim Carey movie quote 'Smokin'.

...and yes, far too much thought and time went into it.
